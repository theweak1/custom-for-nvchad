# custom-for-nvchad
This are my files for the lua/custom folder after installving nvchad

## NvChad install
```bash
Windows: git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad $HOME\AppData\Local\nvim --depth 1 && nvim
```
## Adding custom configuration
once that is done, add this repo to the custom folder by doing
``` bash
Windows: cd $HOME\AppData\Local\nvim\lua && mkdir custom && cd custom
```
After creating the custom folder head to [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/theweak1/dotfiles) and copy the content of the custom folder.
